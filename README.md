# Speech-Recognition
This project focuses on recognizing dysarthric speech, a type of speech disorder, by leveraging the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithms. The goal is to enhance the accuracy of automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for individuals with severe dysarthria.
